// Mock the environment variables if not present in actual .env for the script context, 
// but usually we rely on the user having them. 
// Since I can't read .env easily without tool, I will assume the app is running and I can use the same client config if I could find them.
// Actually, I'll read src/lib/supabase.js to see how it's initialized.
// But to run this script node-standalone, I need the URL and Key.
// I'll try to grep them or just assume I can use the existing 'supabase' module if I run it via a method that supports it? 
// No, I'll just write a script that helps me debug by logging what the app would see.
// Better yet, I will verify the 'SantriList.jsx' syntax by *fixing* it to the standard known working syntax if checking fails.

// The standard syntax for foreign key on column 'kelas_id' to table 'kelas' is usually:
// .select('*, kelas(nama)')  <-- if relationship name is 'kelas'
// OR
// .select('*, kelas:kelas_id(nama)') <-- if explicit foreign key column mapping is needed.

// I will create a small UI component in a temporary file to debug this on the running app. 
// No, that's too invasive.

// I'll check 'src/lib/supabase.js' to see credentials if exposed, or just proceed to standardize the syntax.
